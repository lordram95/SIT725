      <h2>Ice Cream Stories</h2>

      <p>
        On a hot summer day in Sydney, a little girl named Mia eagerly waited
        for the familiar jingle of the ice cream truck. Every afternoon, the
        neighborhood kids would gather, clutching their coins, ready to choose
        their favorite flavors. Today was special, though. Mia had saved up
        enough to try a new creation: the "Rainbow Surprise." As she handed her
        coins to Mr. Johnson, the friendly ice cream man, her eyes sparkled with
        excitement. The colorful scoops stacked high on the cone were a sight to
        behold. Mia took her first lick, and her taste buds danced with delight.
        Each layer revealed a new flavor—strawberry, mango, blueberry, and
        lime—bringing a burst of happiness with every bite. She savored each
        moment, sharing laughter and stories with her friends under the shade of
        a big oak tree. For Mia, that simple ice cream cone turned an ordinary
        day into a magical memory, a sweet reminder of the joy found in little
        things.
